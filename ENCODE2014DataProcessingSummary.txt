1. Query "ChIP-seq" AND ("bed_narrowPeak" OR "bed_broadPeak" OR "broadPeak" OR "narrowPeak") on encodeproject.org on Nov. 10, 2014  
	--> 1551 entries, results in ENCODE_ChIPseq_all_20141010.json

2. Download 2803 peak files from 1551 entries; create metadata lookup table ENCODE_ChIPseq_all_20141010_metadata.csv  < parseJson.py >
	689 peak files can't open. All "uniformelyProcessedPeakCalls", probably from ENCODE 2003-2012

3. Map bed files to their metadata. <datset2metadata.py>
	1699 human datasets
	415 mouse datasets
	2114 datasets in total

4. Map peaks to genes. 
	4.1 peak2GeneBatch.java 
	4.2 enrichGene.java  (+/- 2k of TSS)
	4.3 sortGene2.java   (take top 3000 genes according to distance to TSS)

5. Take consensus genes if replicates exist for a unique experiment.  < mergeReplicate.py >
	1053 experiments have no replicates   (keep top 2000 genes)
	525 experiments have two or three replicates   (take consensus genes from top 3000 genes in each replicate)

6. Make gmt files for TFBS and HM.   < makeGMT.py >
	1022 TFBS has >= 100 genes per line. (43 removed)
	508 HM has >= 100 genes per line.  (5 removed)
